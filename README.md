# Particle swarm otimisation 

Particle swarm optimisation (PSO) algorithm is inspired by the swarm intelligence observed in a flock of birds flying or school of fish swimming.
This algorithm can be effective in training neural networks by optimising the error function of the netowrk 
The alogorithm here was created in scilab  and is used as demonstration to try and find the global minimum for the functionn f(x,y)=-(y+47)  sin⁡(√(|y+x/2+47| ))-xsin(√(|x-(y+47)| )).
