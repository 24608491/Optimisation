# Particle swarm otimisation 

The Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO) algorithm is inspired by the swarm intelligence observed in a flying flock of birds or swimming school of fish.
This algorithm can be effective in training neural networks by optimising the error function of the network. 

The algorithm here was created in scilab  and is used as demonstration to try and find the global minimum for the functionn f(x,y)=-(y+47)  sin⁡(√(|y+x/2+47| ))-xsin(√(|x-(y+47)| )). The x and y values are bounded in the range [-512,512]. The algorithm also adopts a dynamic stopping criteria where the algorithm terminates if there are no improving global/local minimum values after 50 iterations. 

An uploaded video shows a simulation of the algoprithm in a contour plot trying to find a minimum value within the specified range of x and y.The algorithm randolmy generates 50 particles and these particles move around trying to find the global/local minimum of the function.
